    "We retrieved data from `Domain.com` and `oldlisting.com` using API and web scraping respectively. We also applied web scraping to retrieve data from `Domain.com`. However, we realised that they are similar from API-retrieved ones and Web-scrapped Domain data contained more error messages and will result in big data loss after data cleaning. Hence, we decided to use API-retrieved Domain data.\n",

    " \n",
    "**Assumption & Limitation:**  We assume that residential data from web scraping might show different or hidden data compared to the data retrieved by API. So we decided to use both web scraping and API methods to retrieve the data and compare between them.\n",

    "**conclusion:** It shows the data from API and web scraping are exactly the same but data from API are more stable for the number of baths and beds. So we decided to use the data from the API.\n",

    "**Approach:** This notebook will retrieve data at Domain using API.However, as you may need to apply for your own client key and secret via https://developer.domain.com.au/ . If you have questions regarding this, please contact the team via jiahe3@student.unimelb.edu.au\n",
    " \n",
    "**Assumption & Limitation:** This data is imbalanced. Most of the data is on 2022 and the rest of few data are historical data, we assume that the domain.com limited the API access of historical data.\n",

    "It will generate the historical data retrieved from the first 100 URLs for example demonstration. However, it is very likely to be blocked if we generate too much data at each time. Hence, the team divided the web scraping tasks and generated them gradually using the notebook script. \n",

    "**Assumption & Limitation:** Although we’ve put `timesleep` within our code, we experienced blockings from the website. We assumed that this happened the website may cumulatively count the number of times we made requests. Hence, we made some improvements. First improvement was to sparse the scraping work. We did the scrapping day by day with a smaller amount of web scraping so we can finish this task within the scheduled timeline. Another improvement was to use AWS to initiate a virtual environment and change IP while doing the retrieving.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. `/notebooks/Scraping/4.Scraping_whole.ipynb`: \n",
    " \n",
    "**Approach:** This notebook will use an api-rotator through AWSAs to prevent web scraping from being blocked. The historical website monitors IP addresses with high levels of activity, we assume the website counts the number of access by trying many accesses with reasonable breaks and checking when it gets blocked. So there are few solution options and one of them is using an api-rotator through AWS. It is shown in the file `/scripts/aws-scraping-tool.py`. The AWS API key will be hidden in the .env file.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Assumption & Limitation:** As the historical source website blocks the ip address, we assume that if we use a different ip address before the quota use we can scrape unlimited so we use AWS ip-rotator to scarpe the whole historical data.\n",

The selected features of interest that we decided to include were primary/secondary schools, parks, train stations, hospitals, market places, police stations and shopping malls. By querying them by each year with their registered data on the dataset of `https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?url=https://services6.arcgis.com/GB33F62SbDxJjwEL/ArcGIS/rest/services/Vicmap_Features_of_Interest/FeatureServer/8&source=sd`, we could retrieve each year's features of interest locations that is used to calculate the distance between a feature of interest and a rental property from the historical rental property dataset.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Structure of features of interest dataset for each year\n",
    "The way of producing one feature of interest for a particular year is cumulative.\n",
    "eg) To retrieve the data for **marketplaces in 2014**, all the marketplaces registered before 2013 + marketplaces registered in 2013 + marketplaces registered in 2014 are combined. <br/>\n",
    "### The reasons of choosing these particular features\n",
    "We have chosen these 8 features of interest to put into our model as inputs out of many other features of interest in Victoria, since we consider them to have a significant relevance to livability, which is one of the main topic questions. According to Global livability Index 2021 Report `https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/global-liveability-index-2021/`, they stated 5 factors that compose liveability as \"stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure\".\n",
    "**By referring to these five factors, we have chosen the 8 features with the following reasons:** <br/>\n",
    "- Primary/secondary schools: Education\n",
    "- Parks, Shopping malls: Culture and environment\n",
    "- Hospitals: Healthcare\n",
    "- Markets, Police stations, Train stations: Stability, Infrastructure\n",
    " \n",
    "**Assumption & Limitation:** The registered dates seem to be not accurate enough. For example, from this dataset, some train stations that are registered in recent years (2013-2022) were actually built in the 1900s and are not being used anymore. However, since it is impossible to manually search up for every one of these types of features and remove them from the dataset, our team decided to put this as a limitation of our dataset.\n",
    "We have collected market locations in victoria state, but entire market place instances are only 7 which seems to be very little to the actual number of market places in Victoria. Also, since the number of instances is too small, it is hard to expect the distances between a property and the nearest market place to be a significant variable to predict weekly rent. Therefore, the marketplace folder was not used.\n",

    "**Overall Approach:** There are many options to add SA2.\n",
    "First we add SA2 using suburb name as generally SA2 name refers to suburb in the residential address (see document  https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/lookup/by%20subject/1270.0.55.001~july%202016~main%20features~statistical%20area%20level%202%20(sa2)~10014) however there are many of them fail to match with SA2 name because of different formats, some of region added prefix or suffix (ex. -south, -north, the great-, etc...) and the few regions that have totally different name to SA2 name. \n",
    " \n",
    "Second, we use location data to add SA2. This approach is genuine method as the all of data has location meta data in the website and API and the data loss is less than 0.5% (few data is located outside of victoria) and easy to process. For the process, we use shap file from ABS (https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026/access-and-downloads/digital-boundary-files) and map polygon coordinates and check which region contains the residence locations. This will assign SA2 code to every residential locations. \n",

    "2. `/notebooks/Preprocessing/2.add_SA2_coordinate_API.`: \n",
    " \n",
    "**Approach:** This notebook will add 2021 SA2 code for each property instance retrieved by Domain API. This is done by checking whether the location point (longitude, latitude) is within the SA2 polygon from the shape file.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Assumption & Limitation:** There were a few data losses. We assume these data losses were reasonable because the coordinates point to outside of Victoria when we plot the unmatched data to the map. Another limitation for this is we used brutal force to check whether one location is within a shape file, hence running the function may take long.\n",

    "### 2.1.5 Feature Engineering for Property Dataset\n",
    " \n",
    "**Approach:** We engineered `residence type` as a binary feature (House or Apartment). This is because this project analyses residential properties, hence we excluded rental properties for office, holiday, rural area etc. We classified the rest residence type with logistic regression into `House` including townhouse, terrace, etc. and `Apartment` including unit, studio etc. for simplification so that we can ask our client for their rental residence type preference.\n",

    "## 2.2 External Dataset Preprocessing\n",
    "**Approach:** The notebook script `/notebooks/External/1.external_preprocess.ipynb` is used to do preprocessing on those external dataset (estimated resident population, total income, crime cases, GDP, saving rate), and store into the curated folder in the data folder. We calculated the population density for each sa2 region (2021), income per person per year for each sa2 region (2016) based on the dataset of estimated resident population and total income respectively. We tried to convert the 2016 sa2 of income to 2021 sa2, but this would lead to lots of data missing. Therefore, we decided to use 2016 sa2 for later merging. There are also some plots for different types of offence.\n",

    "## 2.3 Data Merging\n",
    " \n",
    "### 2.3.1 Adding SA2 2016\n",
    "**Approach:** There were issues that arose that the statistical data (including population, income, etc...) before 2021 had a different SA2 code standard established in 2016. Every five year the SA2 code standard gradually changes so we need to add more SA2 code standards to the instance. As the name and area of SA2 codes change, we need stable data to match the code. The using location data is decided as an fitable method because it is stable and can point directly what SA2 region it was used to belong to in the past.\n",
    "To view these steps please see `/notebooks/Preprocessing/7.add_SA2_2016.ipynb` and `/notebooks/Preprocessing/8.organising.ipynb`.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Assumption & Limitation:** As the external data is from 2013 to 2021, the standard of SA2 in some data is based on 2016. Therefore we assume that each of the houses and apartments remain the same coordinates whenever it is 2013 or 2021 and we decide to add SA2 2016 code using coordinates. This is the same as the previous methods.\n",
    " \n",
    "### 2.3.2 Adding External Features\n",
    " \n",
    "**Approach:** For merging external data of 2013 to 2022, the notebook script `/notebooks/External/2.external_merge.ipynb` is used to merge external attributes (GDP and saving rate, income per person for each sa2, population density and crime cases) with the data in the min_distance_sa2_organised folder in curated folder, and also drop months to get values of all attributes based on year. If the values of external attributes (GDP and saving rate, income per person for each sa2, population density and crime cases) are missing, the predicted values for the external attributes (in the features_prediction folder in curated folder) are used to merge.\n",
    " \n",
    "For merging predicted values of external attributes of 2023 to 2027, the notebook script `/notebooks/External/3.2023_2027_merge.ipynb` is used to merge predicted values of external attributes (GDP and saving rate, income per person for each sa2, population density and crime cases) with the postcode of Local Government Area (LGA), 2016 sa2 codes and 2021 sa2 codes from 2022 dataset. Since the 2022 dataset has the most values of postcode, sa2 2021 and sa2 2016, and includes all values from previous years of those attributes, postcode, sa2 2021 and sa2 2016 from 2022 dataset will be used for further prediction. The predicted values of the external attributes, that are used for merging, are from the features_prediction folder in the curated folder.\n",

The strength of random forest regressor that can be trained on both categorical and continuous values, was another reason to choose to use this model as we have 2 categorical variables, residence type and SA2 codes. <br/>\n",
    "However, since we are not entirely sure if the random forest regression will work fine with our dataset, we still had to test the model before training the model with the dataset. To see the testings on random forest regression in terms of testing and training accuracies, please refer to `/models/randomForest.ipynb`. To see the implementation of the random forest regression and its predictions, please refer to `/models/pred_w_random_forest.ipynb`. \n",
    " \n",
    "**Features used:** All features were selected after the forward selection using MSE from a random forest tree. By referring to the overview of the features, all the internal features and the distance features from the external are assumed not to be changed in the next 5 years (2023 - 2027). The other features which we call them by ‘economics factors’ (GDP, saving rate, income per person, crime case, and population density) were predicted with linear and quadratic regressions and have corresponding values for each future year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027). Henceforth, we need to have all economic features because otherwise, without these economic features the prediction input dataset will have the same feature data for all the next five years. Therefore, we decided to put only the internal predictors and distance predictors from the external into the forward feature selection with the lowest MSEs. To have small MSE (mean square error) values can relate to a better performance of the prediction model in terms of accuracy.\n",
    "After running the forward selection with MSEs, we got all the internal and distance predictors which mean all the features are needed to predict weekly rental price with random forest regressor. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings:** We have predicted the weekly rental price for each property in each district throughout 2023 - 2027. They are organised in csv format with columns of year of prediction, SA2 code of a rental property, predicted weekly rental price of a rental property. These data will be used to compute an average growth rate for the future years. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Any issues you ran into:** In order to convert categorical data into numerical data, we first used get_dummies function but by doing so, the columns (features) for training and prediction dataset were different which was hard to manage and had to choose loss of some data due to this by dropping the columns that are not showing up both training and prediction datasets. This happened mainly due to SA2 codes where a few of them were missing in the prediction dataset and the main characteristic of random forest regressor that requires the exact same features for both training and prediction stages. This issue has been handled by adopting a different converting method, labelEncoding().\n",
    " \n",
    "**Assumption & Limitation:**\n",
    "It is erased from `/models/randomForest.ipynb` notebook, but the feature selection was implemented by recursive feature elimination (RFE) because the random forest regressor only provides feature importances which leave us to select features out of them by ourselves. However, RFE method was deleted since it takes an extremely long time and could not be done with our current devices, where the kernel gets killed in the middle of running the feature selection. Therefore, due to the limitation of hardwares, we implemented forward selection instead. \n",

    "### 4.3 Rental Price Growth Rate Calculation\n",
    " \n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "Based on prediction results from 2023-2027, rental prices are aggregated to average per SA2 district per year. The same aggregation is applied to the year 2022 rental dataset, which is then concatenated to the prediction set. Growth rate of a district in the current year is calculated by (average rental price of district in current year)-(average rental price of district in past year) / (average rental price of district in past year). The average future growth rate for a district is then calculated by (sum of yearly growth rates from 2023 to 2027 of the district) / (5). At the end of this notebook, it returns a csv file such as `/data/curated/final_growing_rates_rf.csv` that shows the average growing rate predicted for the next 5 years of each suburb, sorted in an descending order of average growing rate.\n",

    "**Assumption and limitation:**\n",
    "The avearged growth rate per sa2 suburb may be heavily depend on the number of properties in that suburb. Hence the result may be biased when the number of suburb is small in an sa2 suburb.\n",
    "The average of the next five year growth rate may not be aggregated result and reflective enough ."

    "`notebooks/Liveability/scoring.ipynb`: \n",
    "**Approach:** This notebook developed a ranking system for liveability scoring (0-100). The notebook firstly checked the distribution of each feature to see whether standardisation can be applied. Unfortunately, data were not normally distributed. Hence we used score = rank / len(df) to perform the score for each livability criteria and sum them with weight specified by our user.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Assumption & Limitation:** We assume that the livability score is subjective and individuals care more about the livability based on their own standards. For limitation, we found that the distribution of the distance features were not normal, hence we didn’t standardise the distances. Instead, we used ranking to add up a score between 0 and 1. \n"
